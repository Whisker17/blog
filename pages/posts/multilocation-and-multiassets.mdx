In a multi-chain universe, cross-chain interoperability plays a pivotal role. Substrate tackles this challenge by introducing XCM, a standardized cross-chain message-passing protocol. Through the XCMP protocol, Substrate empowers network-layer functionality, allowing the seamless delivery of XCM-formatted messages to other participating parachains. This article provides an in-depth exploration of building a secure and highly available cross-chain transaction, delving into the low-level aspects and the transaction structure design within Substrate's XCM framework.

## MultiLocation

Accurately describing the origin and destination of assets is of paramount importance in cross-chain transactions. It is essential to establish a clear identification of the transacting parties to ensure consensus and successful completion of the transaction on the blockchain. To address this challenge, the XCM design incorporates a concept called MultiLocation — an abstract data type specifically designed for cross-chain operations. MultiLocation enables the specification of sending and receiving addresses for messages across different chains, facilitating seamless interoperability.

### What Is the Location?

Location refers to an isolated state machine in a consensus system; for example, an account in Ethereum can be identified as a location, and the following information can be identified as a location in XCM:

- A layer-1 blockchain，e.g. the Bitcoin mainnet or a parachain

- A layer-0 superchain，e.g. the Polkadot Relay chain

- A layer-2 smart contract, e.g. an ERC-20 on Ethereum

- A logical functional component of a chain, e.g. a single instance of a pallet on a FRAME-based Substrate chain.

- An account

However, it's crucial to keep in mind that `MultiLocation` **is limited to defining the relative path between two locations and does not encompass a global location.**

### Implementation

```rust
pub struct MultiLocation {
	pub parents: u8,
	pub interior: Junctions,
}
```

The structure of `MultiLocation`, as depicted above, highlights the importance of specifying the order of the relative path since `MultiLocation` operates based on a relative path concept. In its design, `MultiLocation` incorporates the `parents` parameter, indicating the number of hops required for a transaction's origin to exit the current consensus system. This design choice underscores that XCM's cross-chain operations rely on vertical information transmission.

Additionally, to ensure clarity regarding the recipient's location, we need to specify the downward process. This is achieved through the use of the second parameter, `interior`, which is an enum structure called `Junctions`. `Junctions` indicates the number of sub-consensus systems the recipient needs to traverse. The structure of `Junctions` is as follows:

```rust
pub enum Junctions {
	Here,
	X1(Junction),
	X2(Junction, Junction),
	X3(Junction, Junction, Junction),
	X4(Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction),
	X5(Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction),
	X6(Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction),
	X7(Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction),
	X8(Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction),
}
```

The `Junction` represents the item enum of different locations, which can be selected by the developer according to the different destinations, a few of the more commonly used ones are described here:

| **Name**       | **Description**                                                                                                         | **Use Case**                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Parachain      | An indexed parachain belonging to and operated by the context.                                                          | Parachains                        |
| AccountId32    | A 32-byte identifier for an account of a specific network that is respected as a sovereign endpoint within the context. | Parachain accounts                |
| AccountIndex64 | An 8-byte index for an account of a specific network that is respected as a sovereign endpoint within the context.      | Parachain accounts                |
| AccountKey20   | A 20-byte identifier for an account of a specific network that is respected as a sovereign endpoint within the context. | Ethereum, Bitcoin, Smart contract |
| PalletInstance | An instanced, indexed pallet that forms a constituent part of the context.                                              | Pallet in a Frame-based chain     |

### Examples

- Assuming that we need to initiate a transaction from a parachain to the relay chain, an instance of `MultiLocation` should be as follows:

  ```rust
  MultiLocation {
      parents: 1,
      interior: Junctions::Here,
  }
  ```

This is because the assets only need to be hopped up once from the parachain to the relay chain, while no longer needing to be positioned downwards.

- Suppose we need to initiate a transaction from a parachain (Moonbeam) to another parachain (Acala), then an instance of `MultiLocation` should be as follows:

  ```rust
  MultiLocation {
      parents: 1,
      interior: Junctions::X1(
              Junction::Parachain(ParachainId::from(200)),
      ),
  }
  ```

This is because to move from one parachain to another, the asset only needs to be hopped up once and also positioned down once.

- Assuming we need to initiate a transaction from a parachain (Moonbeam) to a Pallet, an instance of `MultiLocation` should be as follows:

  ```rust
  MultiLocation {
      parents: 1,
      interior: Junctions::X2(
              Junction::Parachain(ParachainId::from(100)),
              Junction::PalletInstance(1),
      ),
  }
  ```

This is because to go from a parachain to a Pallet, the asset only needs to be hopped up once, while also being positioned down twice (once to the parachain and once to the associated Pallet).

## MultiAsset

In addition to ensuring the precise location of transacting parties, ensuring the determinism of assets is equally important. By designing a general asset representation standard, we can effectively showcase interoperability between different chains, breaking down barriers and effortlessly handling diverse types of assets.

### Implement

```rust
pub struct MultiAsset {
	pub id: AssetId,
	pub fun: Fungibility,
}
```

This represents the core expression of assets in XCM, introducing two key fields: `id` and `fun`.

```rust
pub enum AssetId {
	Concrete(MultiLocation),
	Abstract([u8; 32]),
}
```

The `id` field serves as the identifier for assets and supports two approaches: **Concrete** and **Abstract**.

For Concrete asset identity, `MultiLocation` is utilized to provide asset positioning. On the other hand, Abstract asset identity employs an abstract location, which represents a name that may refer to different specific locations on various chains and at different times.

The `fun` field indicates that `MultiAsset` supports two different types of tokens: **Fungible** and **Non-Fungible**. This is straightforward to understand.

For Fungible Tokens (FT), the quantity of tokens needs to be specified, represented by a non-zero numeric value. In contrast, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) do not require a quantity; instead, they require an index or another data type that uniquely identifies the instance.

As the fundamental data structure, `MultiAsset` is complemented by additional composite structures in XCM, facilitating developers in utilizing cross-chain asset identification more effectively.

#### MultiAssets

Indeed, this is easy to grasp. Developers can use `MultiAssets` to indicate a group of MultiAsset, which essentially takes the form of a Vector of MultiAsset.

```rust
pub struct MultiAssets(Vec<MultiAsset>);
```

#### WildMultiAsset

`WildMultiAsset` offers developers a wildcard that allows for matching one or more `MultiAssets`.

```rust
pub enum WildMultiAsset {
	All,
	AllOf { id: AssetId, fun: WildFungibility },
	AllCounted(#[codec(compact)] u32),
	AllOfCounted {
		id: AssetId,
		fun: WildFungibility,
		#[codec(compact)]
		count: u32,
	},
}
```

Of which:

- **All** - Represents all assets and does not require any processing.

- **AllOf** - Represents all assets of a specific type and fungibility. By specifying an `AssetId` and `WildFungibility` parameter, it encompasses all assets that share the same type and fungibility.

- **AllCounted** - Represents a defined quantity of assets. It signifies all assets held within a certain maximum limit.

- **AllOfCounted** - Represents a specific quantity of assets of a particular type and fungibility. Similar to the second variant, it also imposes a maximum limit on the quantity. By providing an `AssetId`, `WildFungibility`, and count parameter, it denotes a certain number of assets held that possess the same type and fungibility.

#### MultiAssetFilter

This serves as a filter for `MultiAsset`, combining `MultiAssets` and `WildMultiAsset`. It enables the specification of either a wildcard or a specific (non-wildcard) list of assets.

```rust
pub enum MultiAssetFilter {
	Definite(MultiAssets),
	Wild(WildMultiAsset),
}
```

Of which:

- **Definite** - Represents a specific asset filter. It uses the specified MultiAssets structure as a filter to exclusively select assets that match the MultiAssets structure entirely.

- **Wild** - Represents a wildcard asset filter. It employs the specified WildMultiAsset structure as a filter to select assets that meet the wildcard conditions. The wildcard can encompass all assets of a specific type and fungibility or a specific quantity of assets.

## Outros

The in-depth analysis of `MultiLocation` and `MultiAsset` presented above highlights their significance for developers before embarking on the use of XCM. Similar to XCM's goal of ensuring unambiguous cross-chain asset transfers and their destinations, clarity and determinism play vital roles in facilitating seamless cross-chain information transmission.
