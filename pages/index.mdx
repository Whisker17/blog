## About Me

Hey, I'm Whisker, a protocol researcher and technical writer at [Mantle Network](https://www.mantle.xyz/). My work focuses on blockchain protocol design and optimization, particularly in areas like high-performance blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs, and cryptography.

I'm passionate about exploring and explaining complex blockchain architectures and cryptographic systems in an accessible way. Currently, I spend most of my time researching Layer 2 scaling solutions and contributing to Mantle's technical documentation and blogs.
